# 📊 Sample GTFS Data for DelaySenseAI

This directory contains sample GTFS data files to help you get started with DelaySenseAI without needing your own transit data.

## 📁 Files Included

- **`routes.txt`** - Sample route definitions
- **`trips.txt`** - Sample trip schedules
- **`stop_times.txt`** - Sample stop arrival/departure times
- **`stops.txt`** - Sample stop locations
- **`calendar.txt`** - Sample service schedules
- **`calendar_dates.txt`** - Sample service exceptions

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Copy these files** to your main project directory
2. **Run the main pipeline**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. **Launch the dashboard**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run dashboard.py
   ```

## 📊 Data Overview

This sample data represents a fictional transit system with:
- **5 routes** (bus and train services)
- **50+ stops** across different areas
- **100+ trips** with realistic schedules
- **Weekday and weekend** service patterns
- **Peak and off-peak** time variations

## 🔧 Customization

You can modify these files to:
- **Add more routes** and stops
- **Change service patterns** (peak hours, frequencies)
- **Adjust geographic coverage** (different cities/regions)
- **Modify delay patterns** (congestion hotspots, transfer points)

## 📈 Expected Results

With this sample data, you should see:
- **Delay predictions** across different routes and times
- **Hotspot identification** in specific areas
- **Transfer reliability** analysis between routes
- **Time-based patterns** showing peak hour effects
- **Model performance** metrics and visualizations

## 🌍 Real-World Usage

For production use, replace these files with:
- **Your actual GTFS data** from your transit authority
- **Historical delay data** for better model training
- **Real-time feeds** for live predictions
- **Custom features** specific to your system

## 📝 Data Format

All files follow the [GTFS specification](https://gtfs.org/reference/static):
- **Comma-separated values** (.txt format)
- **UTF-8 encoding** for international characters
- **Required fields** as per GTFS standard
- **Optional fields** for enhanced analysis

## 🚨 Important Notes

- **This is sample data** - not real transit information
- **Coordinates are fictional** - don't use for navigation
- **Schedules are simplified** - real systems are more complex
- **Delays are simulated** - replace with real data when available
