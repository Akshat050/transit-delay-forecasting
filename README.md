**DelaySenseAI** is a machine learning-powered transit delay forecasting system that converts GTFS static schedules into actionable predictions. It helps transit authorities proactively manage reliability, target hotspots, and improve rider experience.

## üåü Features

- **üöÄ Pre-trip Delay Forecasts**: Predict delay probability and magnitude for any route/trip/stop combination
- **üó∫Ô∏è Interactive Hotspot Maps**: Visualize delay risk across your transit network
- **üìä Route-Specific Analysis**: Deep dive into individual route performance
- **‚è∞ Time-Based Patterns**: Identify peak hour bottlenecks and temporal trends
- **üîÑ Transfer Reliability**: Predict connection success probability between routes
- **üß™ What-If Planning**: Simulate schedule changes and see predicted impacts
- **üìà Model Performance**: Comprehensive evaluation with calibration curves and SHAP analysis

## üéØ Use Cases

- **Transit Planners**: Optimize schedules and identify high-risk segments
- **Operations Teams**: Proactively manage service reliability
- **Riders**: Get delay risk information for trip planning
- **Analysts**: Understand network performance patterns
